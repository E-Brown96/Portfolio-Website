            <h2 class = "newH">Number Guesser</h2>
            <p class = "newP"> Number Guesser was another project focused on javascript, this is a basic game in which the player
                chose a number, using the up and down arrows, between 1 and 10. Then once the program runs it will 
                generate a number for the player's computer opponent and a random number that the players have to get close to. 
                The final part is the program compares the players number and the computers number to judge which is closer to the 
                initial number, and returns whether the player has won or lost. This is another project that was part
                of the Codecademy course and the HTML and CSS was already provided with myself adding in the Javascript 
                functionality. A link to the project on my github page
                is: <a href="https://e-brown96.github.io/Number-Guesser/"target="_blank">Number Guesser</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mixMess">
            <p class="newP">Mixed Messages is a project that is purely javascript, the aim is to randomly generate 
            a motivational message everytime the program is run. It uses the Math.random function to select three seperate 
            random numbers with these numbers corresponding to a part of the motivation message. This 
            project is part of the Codecademy course but one without specific direction or instruction,
            the brief is simply what you would get in the workplace. Below is a link to the project on my github page, but note
            this will take you to the github page displaying the code rather than a webpage as it is solely javascript not html:
            <a href="https://github.com/E-Brown96/Mixed-Messages/blob/main/script.js"target="_blank">Mixed Messages</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="newH">CTHD</h2>
            <p class="newP"> Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is my own project, that is to create a website for an NFT (Non fungible Token)
                project. The wesbite utilises HTML and CSS to create a landing page for the website. This website is still
                in development as I want to learn solidity and develop the NFT's in conjunction with this web page so for
                the time being it is simply a landing page. A link to the project on my github page
                is: <a href="https://e-brown96.github.io/CTHD/"target="_blank">Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cheatSheet">
            <p class="newP"> This project involved the use of HTML and CSS to produce a HTML and CSS cheat sheet. Essentially I used mainly
                HTML forms to produce a webpage that includes all my notes, tips and tricks. This is another project that was part
                of the Codecademy course however the instructions were simply to produce  cheat sheet and I took that 
                initial directive, made a plan and formulated the webpage. A link to the project on my github page
                is: <a href="https://e-brown96.github.io/HTML-Cheat-Sheet/"target="_blank">HTML and CSS Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>

        <div class="webDesign">
            <h2 class="newH">Web Design</h2>
            <p class="newP"> This project involved the use of HTML and CSS to produce a basic webpage that showcases some of the styles that can be 
                achieved using CSS styling with a slight star wars theme. Another project from Codecademy with a very simply brief that 
                I developed upon. A link to the project on my github page
                is: <a href="https://e-brown96.github.io/Web-Design-Project/"target="_blank">Website Design System</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="teaCosy">
            <p class="newP"> This project involved the use of HTML and CSS to produce a webpage for the fictitious company Dasmotos Arts and Crafts
                This was a codecademy project that involved following the instructions step by step in the brief and using flexbox to re-organise
                the webpage to make it visually more appealling. A link to the project on my github page
                is: <a href="https://e-brown96.github.io/Tea-Cosy/"target="_blank">Tea Cosy</a>.</p>
