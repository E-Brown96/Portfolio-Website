          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Firstly I want to say thank you for taking the time to look through my personal website.
             I am always looking to work on and improve the site and welcome any suggestions that you 
             think might improve the experience. If you have any suggestions please use the <a href="contactMe.html">Get In Touch</a>
             page to contact me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always possessed an interest to create and build, to solve problems and find 
            innovative solutions both to entertain me and make my life easier in some way. This led
            to me pursing a career within the field of civil and structural engineering, and in doing
            so I achieved a first class masters degree from the <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/"target="_blank">University of Leeds</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since my degree I have spent some time travelling, before jumping into work within the field of
            structural engineering first working for a small company designing facade systems for building,
            before moving onto a global company where I specialised in the design of railway related structures.
            Whilst I enjoy the problem solving aspect of engineering and believe this would be of use to me
            within my coding career I find myself drawn to software developing and the power, freedom and challenge this presents.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently empolyed as a structural engineer and in my spare time I am learning to code through the 
            online learning company <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. I have so far
            learnt the languages HTML, CSS and Javascript and I am working towards the target of becoming a full stack
            developer. I would also like to further my knowledge of Python and the web 3 language Solidity. Through 
            Javascript I have undertaken a number of projects and have also developed some projects of my own.
            If you are interested in my work, you can access it through on my <a href="portfolioPage.html">Portfolio</a>.
